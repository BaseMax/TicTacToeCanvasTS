Live coding project in **TypeScript Global Summit 2023** for a talk about designing the **Tic-Tac-Toe** game.

## Designing an Entertaining Game with Typescript: A Hands-On Approach

Have you ever wanted to build your own game but didn't know where to start? Join us for a live-coding session where we will explore the fascinating world of game development with Typescript. In this 30-minute session, we'll cover the essential steps needed to create a simple 2D game, including:

- Setting up a Typescript project with Canvas
- Drawing game graphics and animations
- Adding keyboard controls to the player sprite
- Implementing game mechanics, such as collision detection and scoring
- Building game levels and improving gameplay with sound effects.

You'll learn how to use HTML5 Canvas to create game graphics, as well as how to use Typescript's strong typing features to build more robust and maintainable game code. We'll also cover the basics of game mechanics, including collision detection and scoring, so you have a foundation to build on.

By the end of this talk, you will have a good foundation for building your own TypeScript game projects. You'll be inspired and motivated to take your newfound skills further and continue building your own games. Join us as we dive into the amazing world of game development with Typescript!
